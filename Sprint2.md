## Work Completed 
We were able to integrate the front end with the back end and create a User inside of the mongo DB database and then have the User input their
information in the sign up and login page. We also implemented test cases using cypress for all of the buttons on the home page and for the login
page which ensures the UI will perform as expected when a User uses it. We also added unit tests for the backend which ensured that the backend would
recieve the information from the frontend. We also, added a test to ensure the login is working properly and ensure we could find a created user 
within the database which we have created. We also added an option on the front page which would ask the user signing up weather they were a doctor. 
If, no is selected we assume the patient is a patient. 

## Issues for this sprint:
### Front End
Ensuring User information is being sent to the back end
Cypress testing 
Selecting physician or patient 
Creating pages onced logged in
Creating taskbar for once logged in

### Back End
Connecting the backend to take information from the front end 
Unit testing for the database
Making sure the database is storing user information 
Matching login attempts to known users.

## What Issues Were Successful
Our group was successful in being able to connect the front end and back end 
We were also able to tests both the front end and the backend
We were able to make a way for a user signing up to be able to chose if they are a physician or patient
We were successfully able to test if a given login is successful or not. 

## What Issues Were not Successful
Creating pages onced logged in
Creating taskbar for once logged in
