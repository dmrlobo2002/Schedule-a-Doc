## Project Name:

Schedule-a-Doc

## Description:

The "Schedule-a-Doc" group will create a webapp that would ideally be used by a doctor's office and its clients. It will be organized as follows:

### Clients:

From this webapp, clients can create an appointment for a specific date and time based on the doctor's availability, see upcoming appointments, and find doctors based on their needs i.e. a client with a sore throat can find an ear-nose-throat specialist via the webapp by selecting "Ear nose and throat" when searching for doctors. It is then up to the doctor to approve or deny the request.

Doctors will be able to upcoming appointments with patients, approve/deny pending appointments, and view patient prescriptions.

The webapp will store whether a user is a doctor or a patient via the backend based on the user's credentials. Permissions will be distributed as such, and each will see different pages depending on who the user is.
